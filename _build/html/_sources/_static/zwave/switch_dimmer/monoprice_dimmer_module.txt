Brief information 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Z-Wave is an interoperable, two-way RF mesh networking technology used for home automation and security. 
	AC-powered Z-Wave devices, such as this dimmer, act as signal repeaters for the Z-Wave network, so multiple devices result in more possible transmission routes, which helps eliminate RF "dead spots" in the network. 
	Any Z-Wave enabled device displaying the Z-Wave logo can be used with Z-Wave devices from other manufacturers.
