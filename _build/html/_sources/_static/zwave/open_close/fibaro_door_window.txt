Configuration description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	#. Alarm cancellation delay
	
		A period of time to cancel alarm from the last change status in device.
			+ Available: 0 ~ 65535 in seconds
			+ Default: 0
			+ Parameter 1, 2 bytes size
			
	#. Device's status change signalled by LED
	
		This setting enables/disables LED notification for each change in device.
			+ Available: 
				- Enable 
				- Disable
			+ Default: Enable
			+ Parameter 2, 1 byte size
	
	#. IN input type
		
		Select type of IN input
			+ Available: 
				- INPUT_NC: Normal close 
				- INPUT_NO: Normal open
				- INPUT_MONOSTABLE 
				- INPUT_BISTABLE 
			+ Default: INPUT_NC
			+ Parameter 3, 1 byte size
	
	#. Association control frame
		
		Type of control frame transmitted for association group 1, activated via IN input. The parameter allows you to specify the type of an alarm frame or to force control frames transmission (BASIC_SET)
			+ Available: 
				- ALARM GENERIC frame
				- ALARM SMOKE frame
				- ALARM CO frame
				- ALARM CO2 frame
				- ALARM HEAT frame
				- ALARM WATER frame
				- Control frame BASIC_SET
			+ Default: Control frame BASIC_SET
			+ Parameter 5, 1 byte size
	
	#. Trigger signal level to associated devices
		
		Value of the parameter specifying the forced level of dimming/ope-ning roller blinds when “switch on”/”open” commands are sent to devices from association group no.1.
			+ Available: 
				- 1 ~ 99: Dim value
				- Turn on associated device with last memorized dim value
			+ Default: Turn on associated device with last memorized dim value
			+ Parameter 7, 1 byte size
	
	#. Alarm cancel transmission
		
		Deactivating transmission of the alarm cancelling frame or the control frame deactivating the device (Basic). It allows for disabling the function of deactivating the device and cancelling alarms for devices associated with IN input.
			+ Available: 
				- Send cancelling information
				- Not send cancelling information
			+ Default: Send cancelling information
			+ Parameter 9, 1 byte size
	
	#. Temperature change report
	
		The difference in temperature between 2 measured times exceeds this setting value will be reported to controller. Otherwise, ignore this change.
			+ Available: 0 ~ 255 units
				- 16 unit = 1 celcius
				- 0 ~ 255 is appropriated with 0 ~ 16 oC and 32 ~ 60.8 oF
			+ Default: 8 (0,5 oC)
			+ Parameter 12, 1 byte size
				
	#. Broadcast alarm control frame
	
		Sending an alarm or control frame (for IN input, depending on parameter no.5 value), and TMP button alarm frame. The frame is sent in “broadcast” mode, i.e. to all devices within range - information sent in this mode is not repeated by the mesh network.
			+ Available: 
				- IN and TMP Broadcast mode inactive
				- IN broadcast mode active, TMP broadcast mode inactive
				- IN broadcast mode inactive, TMP broadcast mode active
				- IN and TMP broadcast mode active
			+ Default: IN and TMP Broadcast mode inactive
			+ Parameter 13, 1 byte size
