How to add to VENUS app  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	**1. Activation**
		- Press "Add button" (button '+') in app
		- Press program button once
		- The LED will blink when the inclusion completes 
		- Wait for VENUS scan & detect this device and inform in app
	
	**2. Reset then re-add**
		- Press "Add button" (button '+') in app
		- Press and hold the button for approx. 2 seconds to reset
		- The LED will blink to indicate device is reset
		- Press program button once to add
		- The LED will blink again, the adding completes
		- Wait for VENUS scan & detect this device and inform in app

LED indicator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	======================================= ========================================================================================
	1 fast blink							Wake-up, notification sent (after quick button press and device is in z-wave network)
	2 fast blink							Water alarm
	3 fast blink							Temperature Alarm (either high or low setpoint triggered)
	4 fast blink							An active alarm has been cleared (when a water alarm or a temperature alarm is no longer active)
	5 fast blink							Low Battery (repeated every approx. 40 seconds)
	1 slow blink							Device in z-wave network (also, after button held while in-Network)
	3 slow blink							Device is removed from z-wave network (also given if adding was not completed)
	======================================= ========================================================================================

Wake-up information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- Wakeup1: Power saving design wakes up every 4 seconds to test water and freeze sensor
	- Wakeup2: Once every 4 approx. hours (default) unit wakes up to send a notification to controller to query and update the status of the unit. A controller can change this wakeup interval. Battery life is decreased when the wakeup interval time is shorter.

Configuration description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	#. Low temperature threshold
	
		This setting defines low temperature threshold. Sensor will alarm in case of detected temperature is lower than this threshold value
			+ Available: -127 ~ 127 degrees in Celcius
			+ Default: 4
			+ Parameter 1, 1 byte size
		
	#. High temperature threshold
	
		This setting defines high temperature threshold. Sensor will alarm in case of detected temperature is higher than this threshold value
			+ Available: -127 ~ 127 degrees in Celcius
			+ Default: 70
			+ Parameter 2, 1 byte size
