Brief information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- Compatible with any Z-Wave or Z-Wave+ Controller
	- Supports protected mode (Z-Wave network security mode) with AES-128 encryption
	- May be connected to any alarm system (potential free output terminal)
	- Extremely easy installation - simply put on a surface prone to flooding
	- May be installed anywhere - flood sensor’s contacts extended with a wire
	- Battery or VDC powered. When connected to an external, VDC power source, the battery serves as an emergency power source
	- Theft protection - tilt is reported to the Z-Wave network or alarm system’s main controller
	- Two operating modes - flood/temperature sensor or just a temperature sensor.
	- Alarm is signalled by sound, visual indicator (LED diode) and Z-Wave

How to add/remove associated device(s) to
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	This device supports 1 association group with 5 nodes.
	
	**To add associated device(s) to this device, below action is required:**
	
	- Add z-wave notified-devices (which will be associated to this sensor) to VENUS
	- Select Associate button and then select notified-device(s) to add
	- Wake-up this sensor: 3 times quick press TMP button (Z-Wave button)
	- If successful, pop-up notification displays in VENUS app
	
	**To remove associated device(s) from this sensor, below action is required:**
	
	- Select Associate button and then select notified-device(s) to remove
	- Wake-up this sensor: 3 times quick press TMP button (Z-Wave button)
	- If successful, pop-up notification displays in VENUS app

Button action and events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- 1 press: select desired MENU option (in case MENU mode is active)
	- 3 presses: add/remove or wake up
	- Press and holding: enter the MENU mode (confirmed by visual indicator)
	
MENU mode & visual indicator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	- Flood alarm is signalled: white and blue light
	- In battery mode, periodically show temperature readouts via LED color
	- In constant powering mode, continuously show temperature readouts via LED color
	- Chosen MENU option is signalled with an illumination color
	
	*MENU mode LED color*
	- White: enter the MENU confirmation
	- GREEN: cancel alarm for associated devices
	- VIOLET: z-wave network's range test
	- YELLOW: sensor reset

Factory reset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	**Resetting the Flood Sensor: Reset procedure deletes EEPROM’s memory, including all information on the Z-Wave network and the main controller.**
	
	#. Make sure the Sensor is powered
	#. Press and hold the TMP button
	#. Wait 15-20 second for visual LED indicator to glow yellow (4th position the MENU)
	#. Release the TMP button
	#. Click the TMP button, once
	#. After few seconds the device will be restarted, which is signalled with the red visual indicator colour and acoustic signal


Configuration description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	#. Alarm cancellation delay
	
		Determines time period, in seconds, by which a Flood Sensor will re-tain the flood state after the flooding itself, has ceased.
			+ Available: 0 - 3600 (in seconds)
			+ Default: 0
			+ Parameter 1, 2 bytes size
	
	#. Acoustic and visual signals On / Off in case of flooding

	#. Trigger level for associated devices
	
		This setting determines dim value that device trigger to associated devices (for multi-level devices).
			+ Available: 
				- Turn ON with dim level, range from 1 ~ 99, ON for binary state devices
				- Turn ON with last memorized dim level, ON for binary state devices
			+ Default: Turn ON with last memorized dim level
